# Recipe_database

## Description
This project provides a console based application that catalogs recipe information. Recipes should have instructions, preparation times, complexity levels, a contributor, one or more authors, a culinary category and a number of ingredients. Users will have a username, a password for their account. Users will be able to input their own recipes by entering aforementioned recipe data. Users should be able to search the application for recipes based on contributor, ingredients, author, food category, or complexity. Users can also write reviews for recipes that they find in order to help others decide if that recipe is worthwhile. After using the search feature to generate a list of recipes, users can look at the full details of a recipe by typing the associated recipe id. From there, they can submit a review for that recipe, or look at reviews associated with that recipe.
